# Native IT | Asset Management
This is a public repository for miscellaneous scripting and function dependencies. 

*PLEASE NOTE* -- This collection is specific to our own internal custom operations and automation routines, and likely won't be very useful unless paired with these systems. In isolation, this repository does not function in any meaningful way and shouldn't be considered reliable for any use outside of Native IT's Asset Management services. 

If you are looking for useful resources related to IT asset management, I recommend starting with [SnipeIT](https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it).

## Support

These scripts were created by numerous individuals and/or organizations who were each working discreetly and without any common organization, project, strategy, or awareness of one another. Furthermore, many of them have been tailored to the specific needs and specifications of their individual author and/or environment. It is therefore impossible to guarantee that any given script or feature will be appropriate for your intended use, or that it will function as expected in your specific environment without first doing a thorough evaluation of your intended application, followed by a careful inspection of the script itself to identify potential areas of concern and ensure its compatibility, predictability, and overall soundness.

## Reporting Concerns

If you think you have found a non-specific problem, or potentially harmful vulnerability in any of the scripts in this repository, please do not hesitate to open an issue. In the event that the problem involves a submodule, I will share the information with its author(s), and ask for their input. Any items that present inherent concerns or risks that cannot be resolved or otherwise justified will be promptly removed.

## Licensing

The majority of the scripts in this repository are linked submodules from other authors, please be sure to respect their individual licensing and preferences for use/re-use. 

Scripts that I have personally authored are generally located in the root of the repository, or within the roots of categorized subfolders. Scripts of my own creation will include my boilerplate at the top, and unless noted otherwise are freely available to be used, modified, or duplicated without limitation or prior approval.

## Contact

If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback that is not covered in the information above, or that you would prefer remain private, you can get in touch by sending an email to [dev@nativeit.net](mailto:dev@nativeit.net).
